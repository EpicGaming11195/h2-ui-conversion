## What I've added/changed
- Removed every Heritage UI customization option that isn't related to Hitman 2.
- Changed the default red color to the pinkish one that H2 uses.
- Added back the pause menu/inventory's background filter from H2.
- Changed the menu music to H2's menu music.

## Credits
[Burn, The Witch](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/121153618), for making Heritage UI, and granting me permission to modify it.

And all the people in Heritage UI's credits. I literally couldn't have done it without you.
