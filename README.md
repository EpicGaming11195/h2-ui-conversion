# Hitman 2 UI Conversion
The sequel to Hitman 2016 UI Conversion, aiming to replicate Hitman 2's UI as closely as possible.

My UI Conversion mods exist because the whole WoA trilogy is now merged into one game, so why not let players make it look like their personal favorite installment in the trilogy?

This mod may feel more polished at times than H2016 UI Conversion, because H2's UI is a lot more similar to the current UI than H2016's is, so it was a lot easier to perfectly match things to the way they were.
Plus, I started the development of this mod while already having all the knowledge I've gathered from developing H2016 UI Conversion, and I had no experience at all when starting H2016 UI.
H2016 UI will likely be brought up to the same standards eventually, but I can't say if or when that will be.

## What I've added/changed
- Removed almost every Heritage UI customization option that isn't related to Hitman 2.
- Recolored basically everything to match how it was in Hitman 2.
- Changed the pause menu/inventory's background filter to the one from Hitman 2.
- Changed the menu music to H2's menu music.
- Removed the small delay that Hitman 3 added to the hover animation of menu tiles.
- Added back the closing animation that Hitman 3 removed from dialog pop-ups.
- Made Simple Button Tiles (e.g. the buttons in the Destinations tab) pop out when hovered over, like they did in H2.
If there's something in this changelog that you don't like, there may be an option to turn it off in the mod settings.
